# Python - else in Loop
As you have learned before, the else clause is used along with the if statement.

Python allows the else keyword to be used with the for and while loops too. The else block appears after the body of the loop. The statements in the else block will be executed after all iterations are completed. The program exits the loop only after the else block is executed.

## Syntax 
```python

for counter in sequence:
    #Statements inside for loop block

else:
    #Statements inside else block
```

#### Example:
```python

for x in range(5):
    print ("iteration no {} in for loop".format(x+1))
else:
    print ("else block in loop")
print ("Out of loop")

Output:
iteration no 1 in for loop
iteration no 2 in for loop
iteration no 3 in for loop
iteration no 4 in for loop
iteration no 5 in for loop
else block in loop
Out of loop

```
## Once loop is done ELSE would be executed

#### Example:
```python

for i in range (5):
    print(i)

Output:
0
1
2
3
4
```

#### Example:
```python

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

else:
    print("loop is done")

Output:
0
1
2
3
4
loop is done
```

#### Example:
```python

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    if i==3:
        break

else:
    print("loop is done")

Output:
0
1
2
3
```

#### Example:
```python

i = 0
while i < 8:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

else:
    print("loop is done")

Output:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
loop is done
```

#### Example:
```python

i = 0
while i < 8:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
    if i == 4:
        break  
else:
    print("loop is done")

Output:
0
1
2
3
```
