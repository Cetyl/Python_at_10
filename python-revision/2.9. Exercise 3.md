# Exercise 3 
Create a program capable of displaying questions to the user like KBC. Use List data type to store the questions and their correct answers. Display the final amount the person is taking home after playing the game.

#### Example 1 :
``` python
import time
print("lets play KBC")
time.sleep(5)
print("your question is")
time.sleep(3)
print("which of the following is a fruit")
time.sleep(3)
print("options are as follows")
time.sleep(2)
print ("A. Tomato, B. Onions, C. Peas, D. Apple")
int = ["A. Tomato", "B. Onions", "C. Peas", "D. Apple"]
ans = input("please choose your Option : ")
if ans==int[3]:
    print("correct answer")
else:
    print("wrong answer")

Output:

your question is
which of the following is a fruit
options are as follows
A. Tomato, B. Onions, C. Peas, D. Apple
please choose your Option : D. Apple
correct answer
```

#### Example 2 :
```python
import time
name= input("whats your name ?? ")
time.sleep(2)
print("Hello", name,"welcome to KBC")
time.sleep(2)
print("Hope you are comfortable , lets start playing KBC")
time.sleep(2)
print ("Your first question is on the screen , lets go")
time.sleep(1)

que = ["what is love ?","who is lambu","what is pen called in german"]
options = ["a. Illusion , b. Jailer , c. Dog , d. Baby dont hurt me no more", "a. Cricketer, b. Rainman, c. Footballer, d. Dancer", "a. Kuli, b. Cerny, c.Tenny, d.Kenny"]
answer = ["d","c","a"]
amount = [1000 , 2000 ,3000]

print(que[0])
print(options[0])
answer1 = input("right option is ")
if answer1 == answer[0]:
    print("correct answer you have won",amount[0],"dollars")

    time.sleep(1)
    print(que[1])
    print(options[1])
    answer1 = input("right option is ")
    if answer1 == answer[1]:
        print("correct answer you have won",amount[1],"dollars")

        time.sleep(1)
        print(que[2])
        print(options[2])
        answer1 = input("right option is ")
        if answer1 == answer[2]:
            print("correct answer you have won",amount[2],"dollars")
        else:
            print ("wrong answer , yout amount to take home is" ,amount[1],"dollars")
