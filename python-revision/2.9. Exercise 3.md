# Exercise 3 
Create a program capable of displaying questions to the user like KBC. Use List data type to store the questions and their correct answers. Display the final amount the person is taking home after playing the game.

#### Example 1 :
``` python
import time
print("lets play KBC")
time.sleep(5)
print("your question is")
time.sleep(3)
print("which of the following is a fruit")
time.sleep(3)
print("options are as follows")
time.sleep(2)
print ("A. Tomato, B. Onions, C. Peas, D. Apple")
int = ["A. Tomato", "B. Onions", "C. Peas", "D. Apple"]
ans = input("please choose your Option : ")
if ans==int[3]:
    print("correct answer")
else:
    print("wrong answer")

Output:
lets play KBC
your question is
which of the following is a fruit
options are as follows
A. Tomato, B. Onions, C. Peas, D. Apple
please choose your Option : D. Apple
correct answer
```

#### Example 2 :
```python
name = input("What is your name?\n")

print("\nGood to have you",name,",Welcome to Kaun Banega Crorepati !\n")

print("Here is your first question \n", )

questions = ["What is capital of India? ", "Who won FIFA 2022? ","How many planets in Solar system? ", "What is value of g?"]

answers = ["delhi", "argentina","8","9.8"]

a = 1000
b = 2000
c = 3000
d = 4000

answers1 = input(questions[0])
if answers1.lower() == answers[0]:
    print("Correct answer. You have won", a, "INR\n")

    answer2 = input(questions[1])
    if answer2.lower() == answers[1]:
        print("Correct answer. You have won", b, "INR\n")

        answer3 = input(questions[2])
        if answer3.lower() == answers[2]:
            print("Correct answer. You have won", c, "INR\n")
            
            answer4 = input(questions[3])
            if answer4.lower() == answers[3]:
                print("Correct answer. You have won", d, "INR\n")
            else:
                print("Wrong answer.Your take home amount is",c,"INR\n")
        else:
            print("Wrong answer.Your take home amount is",b,"INR\n")
        
    else:
        print("Wrong answer.Your take home amount is",a,"INR\n")

    print("Galat Jawab, Tumse na ho paai",0,"INR\n")
