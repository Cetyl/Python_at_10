# Raising Custom errors
In python, we can raise custom errors by using the raise keyword.

```python
salary = int(input("Enter salary amount: "))
if not 2000 < salary < 5000:
    raise ValueError("Not a valid salary")
```

In the previous tutorial, we learned about different built-in exceptions in Python and why it is important to handle exceptions. However, sometimes we may need to create our own custom exceptions that serve our purpose.

# Defining Custom Exceptions
In Python, we can define custom exceptions by creating a new class that is derived from the built-in Exception class.

Here's the syntax to define custom exceptions:

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
  # code ...
  pass
try:
  # code ...
except CustomError:
  # code...
```

This is useful because sometimes we might want to do something when a particular exception is raised. For example, sending an error report to the admin, calling an api, etc.

```python

a = (input("enter any value between 5 to 9 or quit"))

if a.lower()=="quit":
    print("its ok msg ended")
    
else:
    a=int(a)
    if (a>=5 and a<=9):
        print("value is valid",a)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Not a valid number")

```
