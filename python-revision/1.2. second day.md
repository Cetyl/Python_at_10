# Create a calculator which gives an output of the mul, div, add,sub, with two numbers ---- you can use variable
``` python
a = 20
b = 4
print("answer of addition is ", a + b ,sep = '~ ' )
print("answer for subtraction is ", a - b ,sep = '~ ' )
print("answer for division is ", a / b ,sep = '~ ' )
print("answer for multiplication is ", a * b ,sep = '~ ' )
 ```

``` python
# second way
print("addition of", a,"+", b, "is", a + b)
print("subtraction of", a,"+", b, "is", a - b)
print("multiplication of", a,"+", b, "is", a * b)
print("division of", a,"+", b, "is", a / b)
```
