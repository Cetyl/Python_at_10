# Understanding `if __name__ == "__main__"` in Python

In Python, the `if __name__ == "__main__"` construct is a common idiom used to determine whether a Python script is being run directly or imported as a module in another script. This guide explains its purpose and usage.

## What is `__name__`?

In Python, every module has a built-in attribute called `__name__`. When a module is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. If the module is imported into another script, `__name__` is set to the module's name.

### Example

Consider a file named `example.py`:

```python
print(__name__)
```

- If you run `example.py` directly:
  ```
  $ python example.py
  Output: __main__
  ```

- If you import it in another file:
  ```python
  import example
  ```

  The output will be:
  ```
  Output: example
  ```

## Purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__"`

The primary purpose of using this construct is to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the module is imported. This is particularly useful for testing or executing code that should only run when the module is executed directly.

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating its use:

```python
# example.py

def main():
    print("This script is being run directly.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Behavior

- When you run `example.py`:
  ```
  $ python example.py
  Output: This script is being run directly.
  ```

- When you import it in another script:
  ```python
  import example
  ```

  No output will occur since `main()` is not called unless the script is executed directly.

## Best Practices

1. **Encapsulation**: Keep code that should only execute when running the script in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.
2. **Modular Code**: This allows for better organization and reuse of code. Other scripts can import the module without executing its main code.
3. **Testing**: Use this pattern for testing functionality in your script without affecting other scripts that import it.

## Conclusion

The `if __name__ == "__main__"` construct is a powerful feature in Python that enhances modularity and reusability of code. It allows scripts to differentiate between direct execution and import, leading to better structured and more maintainable code.
