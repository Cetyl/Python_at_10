## What are Variables?

Variables in Python are used to store data values. They act as placeholders for data, allowing you to perform operations on them and manipulate them throughout your program.

## Local Variables

### Definition

Local variables are variables that are defined within a function and can only be accessed within that function. They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function exits.

### Scope

The scope of a local variable is limited to the block of code in which it is defined. This means that local variables are not accessible outside their function.

### Example

```python
def my_function():
    local_var = "I am a local variable"
    print(local_var)

my_function()  # Output: I am a local variable
# print(local_var)  # This will raise a NameError
```

## Global Variables

### Definition

Global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions.

### Scope

The scope of a global variable is the entire program. Once defined, they remain in memory for the duration of the program execution.

### Example

```python
global_var = "I am a global variable"

def my_function():
    print(global_var)

my_function()  # Output: I am a global variable
print(global_var)  # Output: I am a global variable
```

## Using `global` Keyword

If you need to modify a global variable inside a function, you must declare it as `global`. This tells Python that you are referring to the global variable, not creating a new local variable.

### Example

```python
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    counter += 1
    print(counter)

increment()  # Output: 1
increment()  # Output: 2
print(counter)  # Output: 2
```

## Best Practices

1. **Limit Global Variables**: Use global variables sparingly to avoid confusion and maintain clean code. 
2. **Prefer Local Variables**: Favor local variables when possible, as they reduce the risk of unintended side effects.
3. **Use Functions**: Encapsulate code within functions to improve readability and maintainability.
4. **Document**: Clearly comment on the purpose of any global variables in your code for better understanding.

## Conclusion
Understanding local and global variables is crucial for effective Python programming. Local variables help keep functions independent, while global variables allow for shared data across functions. By using these variables judiciously, you can write more efficient and maintainable code.
