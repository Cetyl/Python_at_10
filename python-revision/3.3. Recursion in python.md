# Recursion in python
Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.

## Python Recursive Function
In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.

#### Example:
```python
def factorial(num): 
    if (num == 1 or num == 0):
        return 1
    else:
        return (num * factorial(num - 1)) 
  
# Driver Code 
num = 7; 
print("Number: ",num)
print("Factorial: ",factorial(num))

Output:
number:  7
Factorial:  5040

## Calculating fibonnachi sequence
#### Example:
```python
def fib(n):
    if (n==0 or n==1):
        return n
    else:
        return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))   


n = int(input("insert the number for fibonnachi sequence "))
print("number is ", n)
print(" fibonnachi is",fib(n))

Output:
number is  8
fibonnachi is 21
```
