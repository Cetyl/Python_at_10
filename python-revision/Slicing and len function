# The length of the string is 5, and the order of characters starts from zero, so H(0), a(1), r(2), r(3), y(4). 
#Back to the code;
#(len(nm)-4 --> 5 - 4 = 1
#(len(nm)-2 --> 5 - 2 = 3
#Hypothetically new statement is print(nm[1:3])
#we know the starting point is 1, but to access the character's order we use n-1 principle.
#So, order of character=n-1
#OC=3-1=2
#Take the order of characters from 1 to 2 from the actual string; hence, the output is (ar).

# slicing of the strings
nm = 'Harry'
# to find length of the strings
print(len(nm))
# output
print(nm[-4:-2])
