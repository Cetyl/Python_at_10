# Excersice 2: Good Morning Sir

Create a python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening.
Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

``` python
import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%M')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%S')
print(timestamp)
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime
```

## Solution

``` python

import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
print(timestamp)

if ( int(timestamp) <= 12 ):
    print("good morning")
    
elif( int(timestamp) > 12 and int(timestamp) < 18 ):
    print("good afternoon")    
    
else:
    print("good evening")

Output
16
good afternoon
 ```
