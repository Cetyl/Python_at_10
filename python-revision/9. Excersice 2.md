# Excersice 2: Good Morning Sir

Create a python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening.
Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

``` python
import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%M')
print(timestamp)
timestamp = time.strftime('%S')
print(timestamp)
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.strftime
```

## Solution

``` python

import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
print(timestamp)

if ( int(timestamp) > 4 and int(timestamp) < 12 ):
    print("good morning its",timestamp,"O'C clock")
    
elif( int(timestamp) >= 12 and int(timestamp) < 17 ):
    print("good afternoon its",timestamp,"O'C clock") 
    
elif( int(timestamp) >= 17 and int(timestamp) < 20 ):
    print("good evening its",timestamp,"O'C clock")      
    
else:
    print("good night its",timestamp,"O'C clock")


Output
16
good afternoon
 ```

## Solution 2

``` python
import time
timestamp = time.strftime('%H')
timestamp1 = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(timestamp1)
n = input("enter name")
c = n.capitalize()

if ( int(timestamp) > 4 and int(timestamp) < 12 ):
    print("Good morning",c,"its",timestamp1,"O'C clock")
    
elif( int(timestamp) >= 12 and int(timestamp) < 17 ):
    print("Good afternoon",c,"its",timestamp1,"O'C clock") 
    
elif( int(timestamp) >= 17 and int(timestamp) < 20 ):
    print("Good evening",c,"its",timestamp1,"O'C clock")      
    
else:
    print("Good night",c,"its",timestamp1,"O'C clock")

Output
17:38:33
Good evening Rohan its 17:38:33 O'C clock


```
